# CFG Project for Team 3 - Bugbyters.
This is the project readme for Code for Good Social Hackathon 2020 for resolving issues faced by 321 Education Foundation.

## Problem statement: 
Design a system to track student level data and engagement on different lessons without adding sign up and login functions. The system should also house a dashboard to view insights at school level using the collected data. The goal is to identify patterns and trends from usage and engagement data, to help improve the program, drive results, increase usage and broaden the customer base.

## Future Scope:
- Use npm packages ***base64-mongo-id*** or ***objectid64*** to resolve the current timestamp generation issue with multiple admins and longer MongoDB UUID issue. The goal is to convert the MongoDB ObjectID into corresponding base64 conversion similar to what YouTube uses to provide unique IDs to their large pool of videos.

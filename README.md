# CFG Project for Team 3 - Bugbyters.
This is the project readme for Code for Good Social Hackathon 2020 for resolving issues faced by 321 Education Foundation.
www.321-foundation.org

## Future Scope:
- Use npm packages ***base64-mongo-id*** or ***objectid64*** to resolve the current timestamp generation issue with multiple admins and longer MongoDB UUID issue. The goal is to convert the MongoDB ObjectID into corresponding base64 conversion similar to what YouTube uses to provide unique IDs to their large pool of videos.
